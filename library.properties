sentence=Smooths noisy analog signals into rock-stable inputs. Define responsiveness via 'Settle Time' (seconds).
paragraph=Stabilizes readings from potentiometers, faders, joysticks. Simple to use and easy to configure. Behind the simplicity runs a resolution-agnostic, EMA-based algorithm with adaptive thresholding (Jacobson/Karels) to eliminate false positives even under severe noise. Includes delta-time compensation for zero-jitter performance and fine-tuning tools for hardware calibration. See repository for performance analysis.
